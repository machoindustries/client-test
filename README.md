# client-test

This is a simple application that provides three types of information about a webpage 
1. The total word count of the entered webpage
2. The top ten words and their counts
3. A pinterest like gallery of any `<img>` or `<picture>` tag

The current version of the code is running at http://xcentiumdemo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/

If you want to run this code locally make sure you have .Net Framework 4.5.2 along with Visual Studio 2015 installed. Pull the current version of the code, build as you normally would and you can debug to preview the application locally.

Thanks!
